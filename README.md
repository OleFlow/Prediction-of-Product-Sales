# Prediction-of-Product-Sales

##Project Overview
**Project Title:** Sales Prediction for a Retail Store

**Project Description:** This project aims to predict the sales of products in a retail store based on various features such as item type, item weight, outlet size, and more. Accurate sales predictions can help the store optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.

#Data Source: The dataset used for this project contains historical sales data for various products in the retail store.

Relevant Insights from the Data
Insight 1: Item Type Distribution
Item Type Distribution

Insight: The bar chart above shows the distribution of products across different item types. "Fruits and Vegetables" and "Snack Foods" are the most common item types, followed by "Household" and "Frozen Foods."

Insight 2: Item Visibility vs. Sales
Item Visibility vs. Sales

Insight: The scatter plot illustrates the relationship between item visibility and sales. There appears to be a weak negative correlation, suggesting that items with higher visibility tend to have lower sales.

##Summary of the Model and Evaluation Metrics
##Model Used: Random Forest Regression

**Model Summary:** The Random Forest Regression model was implemented to predict item sales based on the dataset's features. It showed good predictive performance.

**Evaluation Metrics:**

R-squared (R²): Approximately 0.61
R² measures how well the model explains the variance in sales. An R² of 0.61 indicates that the model accounts for 61% of the variance, indicating a moderate fit.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): [Provide the specific MSE value]
MSE quantifies the average squared difference between predicted and actual sales values. A lower MSE indicates better prediction accuracy.
Final Recommendations
Model Recommendation: The Random Forest Regression model is recommended for predicting sales, as it demonstrated better predictive performance compared to other models evaluated.

**Insights for Stakeholders:**

Focus on optimizing the visibility of products, as items with higher visibility tend to have higher sales.
Pay attention to product categories with high sales potential.
